Bin-Organized EEG Epochs:
 * Bin 1: Chans X Time Points X Trials
 * Bin N: Chans X Time Points X Trials

Q&A: 
(1) Parameters and preprocessing pipeline: depend on your own research question
(2) Reason why they Choose specific parameters: 
 - low pass filter: 6 Hz, they do lose a lot of temporal infomation, but they want to separte alpha-band oscillation
 - smooth: lose some temporal infomation, but gain statistical power
 - not exclude error: depend on research question
 - down-sample: not need ms resolution
 - artifact: they did not throw out trials because of good quality, but should throw out;
    unequal: because of more trials, may have more power; BUT may cause lots of problems -- because of vairations; BUT may solve the problem -- permutation problem
(3) Preprocessing pipeline:
 - Shift event codes
   recommend: polynomial trending
 - Downsample 
 - re-reference/ reference for ICA
 - 0.1 Hz high filter: pretty good to reduce trial-by-trial variation due to low-frequency noise, without lossing too much temporal infomation
   careful about high-pass 
 - Cut out C.R.A.P: often between trials block
 - AR on Continuous Dta
 - Channel Interpolation
 - Add channel locations
 - ICA
 - Pre-binned Data 
 - Creat EventList 
 - Binlister-1: event code 
 - Epoch (baseline correction)
 - Artifact Detection: eye-blinks/eye-movements
* reduce trial-by-trial variation is important for decoding
(4) Correction: A-prior is good, increase power; 
- Recommend FDR first, then if you understand better, could use permutation test
